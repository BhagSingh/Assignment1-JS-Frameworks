JavaScript is a versatile programming language that is widely used for web development. With the introduction of ECMAScript 6 (ES6), developers gained access to new features and syntactic improvements, making the language more powerful and expressive. Node.js, built on the V8 JavaScript runtime, allows developers to use JavaScript on the server-side, opening up possibilities for full-stack development.

In this assignment, we explore the integration of HTML, CSS, and Node.js to create a dynamic web page. The asynchronous file reading capability of Node.js ensures non-blocking operations, enhancing the performance of our application. By utilizing the Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript, we can seamlessly render the content of a text file onto an HTML page.

As a team, we aim to demonstrate our proficiency in handling these technologies and following best practices. The use of meaningful variable names, proper commenting, and adherence to project structure guidelines showcase our understanding of JavaScript frameworks and web development principles.
